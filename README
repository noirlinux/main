NOIR is an independent LinuxÂ® distribution with a focus on performance and practical functionality.

1. Whats Different?

---

NOIR aims to become a minimal general purpose distro for
your pleasure;

- Cutting down on all dependancies and all other bloat to provide you with a functional distro
  with as few packages and a much less combined package weight
  as possible.

- Taking notes from Wyverkiss we want to be as GNU free as we
  can and if we can't at least make GNU software optional.

- We also strive for stability in as much as we love functional minimalism.

3. BINARIES

---

NOTE: This assumes that the user trusts the source of the binary packages.

Regularly updated binaries are provided for the following packages:

- Firefox
- Chromium
- LLVM

Binaries for NOIR (musl) -> https://github.com/kiss-community/repo-bin

### Installing binaries

- Modify `KISS_PATH` such that the `bin` repository takes priority over other repositories:

$ export KISS_PATH=/path/to/main/bin:$KISS_PATH

- The packages can now be installed by a simple [kiss b $PKG && kiss i $PKG] command.
